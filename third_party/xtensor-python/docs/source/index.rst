Python bindings for the xtensor_ C++ multi-dimensional array library.

Introduction
------------

What are ``xtensor`` and ``xtensor-python``?

 - ``xtensor`` is a C++ library for multi-dimensional arrays enabling numpy-style broadcasting and lazy computing.
 - ``xtensor-python`` enables inplace use of numpy arrays with all the benefits from ``xtensor``

     - C++ universal functions and broadcasting 
     - STL - compliant APIs.


The `numpy to xtensor cheat sheet`_ from the ``xtensor`` documentation shows how numpy APIs translate to C++ with ``xtensor``.

The Python bindings for ``xtensor`` are based on the pybind11_ C++ library, which enables seemless interoperability between C++ and Python.

Enabling numpy arrays in your C++ libraries
-------------------------------------------

Instead of exposing new types to python, ``xtensor-python`` enables the use of NumPy_ data structures from C++ using Python's `Buffer Protocol`_.

In addition to the basic accessors and iterators of ``xtensor`` containers, it also enables using numpy arrays with ``xtensor``'s expression system.

Besides ``xtensor-python`` provides an API to create *Universal functions* from simple scalar functions from your C++ code.

Finally, a cookiecutter template project is provided. It takes care of the initial work of generating a project skeleton for a C++ extension based on ``xtensor-python`` containing a few examples, unit tests and HTML documentation. Find out more about the xtensor-python-cookiecutter_.

``xtensor`` and ``xtensor-python`` require a modern C++ compiler supporting C++14. The following C++ compilers are supported:

- On Windows platforms, Visual C++ 2015 Update 2, or more recent
- On Unix platforms, gcc 4.9 or a recent version of Clang
